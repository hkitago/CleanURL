This Safari extension automatically removes tracking parameters and cleans URLs as you browse, making links shorter and more readable. Share cleaner links without exposing personal data embedded in URLs.

Perfect for privacy-conscious users who frequently share links on social media, messaging apps, or email. Whether you're a content creator, researcher, or everyday user, CleanURL helps you share information more privately and professionally.

## Usage
